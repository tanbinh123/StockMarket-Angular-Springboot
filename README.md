# Angular-Springboot-login-app

This is a simple stockmarket app, where you can buy and sell the stocks of Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Tesla and Facebook on realtime rate. The backend is written in Java, I used Springboot. Angular8 is used for frontend. The realtime rates comes from https://iexcloud.io/.
